1. You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write and a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and 2. INPUT N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6. OUTPUT N = 10001001100

2. Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary using at most 32 characters, print "ERROR".

3. Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and next largest number that have the same number of one bits in their binary represenation.

5.4 Explain what the following code does: ((n & (n - 1)) == 0?
